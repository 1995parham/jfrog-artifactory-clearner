# You can use plain text or environment variables with ${VAR_NAME} or $VAR_NAME syntax
# Examples:
#   username = "myuser"              # Plain text
#   username = "${JFROG_USERNAME}"   # From environment variable
#   password = "$JFROG_API_TOKEN"    # From environment variable
username = "your-username"

# List of images to clean in the format: repository/image-name
# You can specify images from different repositories
# Examples:
#   images = ["docker-local/myapp", "docker-prod/backend-service"]
#   images = ["docker-local/frontend", "docker-local/backend", "docker-dev/test-app"]
images = ["docker-local/image1", "docker-local/image2", "docker-prod/production-app"]

# Cleanup Configuration
[cleanup]
# Default settings for all images (can be overridden per-image below)
# Delete images older than this many days
days_old = 30

# Always keep at least this many recent tags per image
keep_minimum = 3

# Set to false to actually delete images (true = preview only)
dry_run = true

# Per-image configuration overrides (optional)
# You can override days_old and/or keep_minimum for specific images
# Examples:
#   [[image_config]]
#   image = "docker-local/critical-app"
#   days_old = 60
#   keep_minimum = 5
#
#   [[image_config]]
#   image = "docker-local/dev-app"
#   days_old = 7
#   keep_minimum = 2
